# More thoughts

I want to see my fitness. More specifically, I want my output time to remain steady 
and high and I want my weight to go down to a level and stabilize and I want 
my strength to go up and my cardio to go up. I need to show that simply and 
detailed.

# Requirements

- I want to prescribe what I should eat and do each day, based on some meta 
requirements
- Part 1 should be exercise
- Part 2 should be food
- Part 3 should be mind

## For exercise:

- Soccer is on Mondays and Thursdays (and scheduled)
- I _should_ walk the dog on weekdays that I don't have class 
- I need to lift at least 3 times a week
- I need to run at least 2 times a week (soccer counts as running)
- I need to have 1 [active] recovery day per week
    - Long, light jog (i.e. 3 miles @ 10 min/mile)
    - 30 minute low impact ride
- I need to have 1 sauna session per week
- I need to have at least one workout session per day
    - Active Recovery
    - Run
    - Soccer
    - Lift
    - Walk longer than 1 hour
    
### Steps to get there:

1. Work out what day I should do each thing
    - If you've had 
2. Work out how to add exclusions and recalculate (i.e. I have to travel or 
something)
3. Work out _when_ I should do each thing on each day (pull in schedule)
4. Give warnings when I am behind 
5. prioritize hard days after easy and vice-a-versa
